    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Now that you have been equipped with the knowledge and skills to process and analyze data with R,
      you will have the opportunity in this final project to practice and apply it by analyzing real-world COVID-19
      testing data online.
    </p>
    <h1>Scenario</h1>
    <p>
      In this scenario, you will play the role of a data analyst who has recently
      joined the data science team of a news channel.
      Your channel’s documentary team channel’s recently accepted an assignment<br>to create a feature story on global COVID-19 testing by country and they need some data-driven insights
      from your team.Your team has been using IBM Watson Studio,
      which is a powerful and easy-to-use platform for data analysis and data science tasks.
      As a new team member, your team leader has assigned this task to you. You need to leverage your R
      skills to acquire the relevant datasets, as well as process and analyze them using Watson Studio.
    </p>
    <h1>Watson Studio</h1>
    <p>
      For this project, you will use Watson Studio. Watson Studio is a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts,
      AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy your projects.
    </p>
    <h1>Step-By-Step Labs</h1>
    <p>
      In this final project, you will webscrape a global COVID-19 dataset from a public wiki page, and conduct various data
      analysis tasks on the data set.
    </p>
    <p>To help you finish the final project, we have prepared several readings and labs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create IBM Cloud account and Watson Studio instance</li>
      <li>Download a skeleton Jupyter notebook with tasks, sample code, and comments via provided URL</li>
      <li>Add the skeleton Jupyter notebook to Watson Studio</li>
      <li>Analyze global COVID-19 testing data</li>
      <li>Share your Jupyter notebook via Watson Studio for peer-review</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Submission</h1>
    <p>
      A screenshot in JPEG format is required to be submitted for solution to each of the problems.
      The screenshot for each task should clearly show the code and output.
    </p>
    <p>The screenshots will be uploaded in the following sections.</p>
    <h2>Example Submissions</h2>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a submission clearly showing both the code and output,
      when executed from a Jupyter notebook.
